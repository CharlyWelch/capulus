## Our team: 
    - Brance Pearson

    - Charly Welch

## Project Pitch:
Modern students and remote workers are moving away from libraries as workspaces and toward cafes and coffeeshops. It can be difficult to locate the space that's just right for an individual. We propose an app that consolidates information about coffee shops and their amenities.

Our app will provide information about:
    - work space
        - outlets
        - atmosphere
        - table space
    - menu
        - food and drink
        - variety
        - pricing
    - community
        - kid friendly?
        - locally owned?
        - neghborhood

This will be done in the following pages:
    - login page
        - take user name
       - links to search page 
       - small text link to suggest a cafe
    - search page
        - populates with cafes
            -img with name and street overlaid 
        - rollover, icons appear
        - click, takes to profile
    - suggest page
        - simple form
    - cafe profile pages
        - name and address in header, over background img of cafe
        - more detailed info on three parameters
        -review form at bottom
    - about Capulus
        - developer bios

With our app, students and remote workers can search nearby cafes and discover which will provide the best working space.
